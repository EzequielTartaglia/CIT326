**W09 Scenario:**

You are motivated by the success of the companies you are working for and are now wondering how you will make things more portable and scalable in the future. You start to ask yourself, “What if our CPU/Memory demands jump significantly?” and “What if I have to be ready to deploy these databases at different locations?” You decide to explore the landscape of cloud platforms to potentially host your databases. You will need a strong understanding of the cloud environment (we are using Google Cloud Platform or GCP) and the basic building blocks therein: virtual machines (VMs) and Docker containers.

**W09 Scenario Submission Guidelines:**

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you have thoroughly reviewed the materials in the preparation assignment this week. For the coming weeks, this will be crucial as we pivot into new technologies. If you are struggling with future scenarios, please go back and review.

You will not be required to do a video this week. Please complete the following:
(10 points) It is time to improve your understanding of when you might use virtual machines and docker containers. Using ChatGPT, ask it to explain the similarities and differences of virtual machines and docker containers as if you were six years old! Ask for examples that a child could understand. Use several follow up questions regarding best use cases for each and the pros and cons. Ask it about how they can help host databases. Have a good conversation and copy and paste in a Word document for a grade.

(20 points) Read and complete the Google Cloud Skills Boost Qwiklab entitled “Introduction to Docker.” Again, this week’s preparation materials will help you understand the point of what you are doing. If you run into trouble, this walkthrough of the qwiklab may help. Follow the screenshot submission details as explained in the stepping stone assignment.
(20 points) Read and complete the Google Cloud Skills Boost Qwiklab entitled “Running Windows Containers on Compute Engine." Follow the screenshot submission details as explained in the stepping stone assignment.

Me: Hey ChatGPT! Can you explain to me the differences between virtual machines and Docker containers like I'm six years old?

ChatGPT: Of course! Imagine you have a box, and inside that box, you can put another smaller box. The big box represents a computer, and the smaller box inside it can be either a virtual machine or a Docker container.

Me: So, what's the difference between the two?

ChatGPT: Well, let's talk about virtual machines first. Think of a virtual machine as a whole playroom inside the big box. It has everything a playroom needs—like toys, furniture, and decorations. But here's the thing: each time you want a new playroom, you need to make a whole new big box with everything inside it.

Me: Oh, I see! What about Docker containers then?

ChatGPT: Docker containers are more like individual toy boxes that you can put inside the big box. Each toy box has its own toys and decorations. And the cool part is, you can have many toy boxes inside the big box without needing to make new big boxes each time.

Me: That sounds handy! When would I use a virtual machine?

ChatGPT: Virtual machines are great when you need separate and isolated environments, like if you want one playroom for playing with Legos and another for playing with dolls. They're also good when you need to run different operating systems, like one playroom for kids who like Windows and another for kids who like Mac.

Me: And when would Docker containers be useful?

ChatGPT: Docker containers are perfect when you want to run lots of small applications that share the same resources, like many toy boxes that share the same playroom space. They're also great for making sure your toys stay organized and don't mix up with each other.

Me: Got it! Are there any downsides to using virtual machines or Docker containers?

ChatGPT: Well, virtual machines can be a bit heavy because each one needs its own operating system and resources. So if you have too many virtual machines, your big box might get crowded and slow. On the other hand, Docker containers are lighter and faster since they share resources, but they might not be as secure if you need really strong separation between your toys.

Me: Thanks for explaining that! How can virtual machines or Docker containers help with hosting databases?

ChatGPT: Ah, good question! Imagine your database is like a big treasure chest, and you need a safe place to keep it. You could use a virtual machine to create a secure room just for the treasure chest, with locks and guards to protect it. Or, you could use Docker containers to divide the treasure chest into smaller compartments, each with its own lock, so different people can access different parts of the treasure.

Me: That makes sense! I think I understand now. Thanks for your help, ChatGPT!

ChatGPT: Anytime! If you have more questions, feel free to ask!
